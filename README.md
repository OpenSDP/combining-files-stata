## OpenSDP Data Janitor Tutorial (Stata)
## Combining Files in Stata: Building an Analysis File

In this tutorial, you will learn Stata commands for combining cleaned data
files to make an analysis file. This tutorial assumes that you have a limited
knowledge of Stata. If you donâ€™t know any Stata at all, you may find it helpful
to complete the OpenSDP Data Exploration Tutorial before starting this one.

In Part 1, you will briefly inspect cleaned student, test score, and
school data files. In Part 2, you will combine the student and test score files;
in Part 3, you will add information about schools; and in Part 4 you
will define several derived variables.

You will need to have Stata version 12 or higher installed on your computer to
run this tutorial. Download, unzip, and extract the files. Open the .smcl file,
and arrange the viewer and main Stata windows side by side so that you can
see them both. Work through the tutorial by clicking on commands in the viewer
window or typing them into the Stata command window.
